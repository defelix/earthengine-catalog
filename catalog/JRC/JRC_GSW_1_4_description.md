    This dataset contains maps of the location and temporal
    distribution of surface water from 1984 to 2021 and provides
    statistics on the extent and change of those water surfaces.
    For more information see the associated journal article: [High-resolution
    mapping of global surface water and its long-term changes](https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v540/n7633/full/nature20584.html)
    (Nature, 2016) and the online [Data Users Guide](https://storage.googleapis.com/global-surface-water/downloads_ancillary/DataUsersGuidev2021.pdf).

    These data were generated using 4,716,475 scenes from Landsat
    5, 7, and 8 acquired between 16 March 1984 and 31 December 2021.
    Each pixel was individually classified into water / non-water
    using an expert system and the results were collated into a monthly
    history for the entire time period and two epochs (1984-1999,
    2000-2021) for change detection.
